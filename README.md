### Original Research by Alexandre D√©fossez and Meta AI Research

**demucs-infer** is built upon the groundbreaking work of [Demucs](https://github.com/facebookresearch/demucs) by **Alexandre D√©fossez** and **Meta AI Research**. The original Demucs represents a major advancement in music source separation, achieving state-of-the-art results through innovative hybrid architectures and transformer-based approaches.

### Research Papers

The models in this package are based on two pioneering research papers:

#### Hybrid Demucs (2021)
**[Hybrid Spectrogram and Waveform Source Separation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.03600)**

This seminal work introduced the hybrid time-frequency domain approach that significantly improved separation quality by combining the strengths of both spectrogram and waveform-based processing.

  title={Hybrid Spectrogram and Waveform Source Separation},
  author={D{\'e}fossez, Alexandre},
  booktitle={Proceedings of the ISMIR 2021 Workshop on Music Source Separation},
  year={2021}
}
```

#### Hybrid Transformer Demucs (2022)
**[Hybrid Transformers for Music Source Separation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.08553)**

This follow-up research integrated transformer architectures into the hybrid approach, further pushing the boundaries of separation quality and establishing new benchmarks in the field.

**What we maintain:**
- PyTorch 2.x compatibility
- Modern dependency management
- Inference-only packaging

**What remains unchanged:**
- All model architectures (100% original)
- All separation algorithms (100% original)
- All model weights (100% original)

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Installation

demucs-infer supports both **UV** (recommended, faster) and **pip** (traditional) installation methods.

#### Option 1: UV (Recommended) ‚ö°

[UV](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) is a blazing-fast Python package installer and resolver.

```bash
# Install UV if you haven't already
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Add to existing project
uv add demucs-infer

# Or create new project with demucs-infer
uv init my-audio-project
cd my-audio-project
uv add demucs-infer

# Run Python with demucs-infer available
uv run python your_script.py
```

**Benefits of UV:**
- ‚ö° 10-100x faster than pip
- üîí Automatic virtual environment management
- üì¶ Consistent dependency resolution
- üéØ Works seamlessly with PyPI packages

#### Option 2: pip (Traditional)

```bash
# Install in current environment
pip install demucs-infer

# Or create virtual environment first (recommended)
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install demucs-infer
```

### Python API

```python
from demucs_infer.pretrained import get_model
from demucs_infer.apply import apply_model
from demucs_infer.audio import save_audio
import torch
import torchaudio

# Load model
model = get_model("htdemucs_ft")
model.eval()

# Load audio
wav, sr = torchaudio.load("song.wav")
wav = wav.unsqueeze(0)  # Add batch dimension

# Separate audio
with torch.no_grad():
    sources = apply_model(model, wav, device="cuda")

# Save separated stems
# sources shape: [1, 4, channels, time]
# sources order: drums, bass, other, vocals
for i, source_name in enumerate(model.sources):
    source = sources[0, i]  # Remove batch dimension
    save_audio(source, f"output/{source_name}.wav", sr)
```

### CLI

**With UV:**
```bash
# Basic usage
uv run demucs-infer "song.wav"

# Extract specific stems (drums only)
uv run demucs-infer --two-stems=drums "song.wav"

# Use specific model
uv run demucs-infer -n htdemucs_ft "song.wav"

# Specify output directory
uv run demucs-infer -o output/ "song.wav"
```

**With pip:**
```bash
# Basic usage
demucs-infer "song.wav"

# Extract specific stems (drums only)
demucs-infer --two-stems=drums "song.wav"

# Use specific model
demucs-infer -n htdemucs_ft "song.wav"

# Specify output directory
demucs-infer -o output/ "song.wav"
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### ImportError: No module named 'demucs_infer'

**With UV:**
```bash
# Make sure you added demucs-infer to your project
uv add demucs-infer

# Or run with UV
uv run python your_script.py
```

**With pip:**
```bash
# Make sure you installed demucs-infer, not demucs
pip uninstall demucs demucsfix
pip install demucs-infer
```

### CUDA Out of Memory

```python
# Use smaller chunks or CPU
model = model.to("cpu")

# Or use two-stems mode (faster)
# demucs-infer --two-stems=drums "audio.wav"
```

### Model Download Issues

```python
# Models are downloaded from official Demucs repositories
# Check internet connection and firewall settings

# Default model cache location:
# Linux: ~/.cache/torch/hub/checkpoints/
# macOS: ~/Library/Caches/torch/hub/checkpoints/
# Windows: %USERPROFILE%\.cache\torch\hub\checkpoints\
